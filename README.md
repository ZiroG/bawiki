This is a public Github archive of my website bawiki.com.

BAwiki.com contains articles about the business analysis profession, or of use to them.  Focusing mainly on BA techniques and concepts.

I am creating this archive on GitHub because I am not sure if I will keep the website up indefinitely.  So this will serve as an archive,
or perhaps the ongoing home for my articles if I decide to take the site down.

While the content is publicly accessible, all content is copyrighted by me.
